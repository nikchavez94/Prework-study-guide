# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
This is the first of many projects to come in the Rice University Coding Bootcamp. This project was meant to expose students entering the bootcamp to the initial ideas of coding a webpage. I built this project in hopes of collecting a set of helpful notes for myself and  other students in similar shoes. The problem this study guide solves is helping to remember key features of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git.

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
